# BCN: BATCH CHANNEL NORMALIZATION


(Link for the paper )
  

This repository contains the pytorch   of the model we proposed in our paper:  BCN: BATCH CHANNEL NORMALIZATION

The code is available in pytorch. To run the project kindly refer to the individual readme file.





## Dataset


CIFAR10/100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), and ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015)







## Proposed Normalization technique


### Visualization on several normalization techniques. Each subplot shows a feature map tensor with N the batch axes, C the channel axes, and (H, W) the spatial height and width axes.

##   Requirements
####  Programming language

The code has been written in pytorch  and requires
torch
scipy,
numpy.

## Some results from our paper
